# Song-Library
RESTful API
Project Description:

We're creating a Spring Boot Application in Java for an online music library's backend. This means we're building the technology that organizes all the information about artists, their songs, and playlists. We're not focusing on the part where users see and use the website; that's the frontend, and it's not part of this project.
